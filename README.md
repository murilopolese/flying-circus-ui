## Flying Circus UI

This repo contains the front end for Flying Circus IDE that communicates with the hardware by exchanging events and messages through a bus.

It's mainly used on [Flying Circus Electron](http://github.com/murilopolese/flying-circus-electron) and [Flying Circus Web](https://github.com/murilopolese/flying-circus-web)
